Introduction
◦ The Recipe Management System has been designed to give the user as
much freedom as possible in recipe input, but the ability to find what you
want quickly is something you will never find in a cookbook.
◦The Recipe Management System is to create a recipe which acts as a
meal management software ‘book’ that allows you to access
an unlimited number of recipes, add your own recipes, share
recipes.
◦ A web-based recipe app that uses Bootstrap 4 as Front-End, JavaScript
as backend, and works with Mongodb Cloud servers.
◦ A platform for users to share awesome and exciting recipe ideas they
have invented or learnt.
◦ A family recipe book using contentful and eleventy
◦ Find your everyday cooking inspiration on Recipe Website. Discover

card collection (responsive).
What is House of Recipes
◦ Recipe hub where a user can :

 Technologies/Platforms Used
◦ Bootstrap and CSS3 to build the UI of the application.
◦ Bootstrap is very useful in saving up time as it has many
components ready for use and very extensive documentation.
◦ Node.js is a server-side platform built on google chrome's
JavaScript V8 engine for easily building fast and scalable network
applications. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js
◦ We have used MongoDB as the database. It is extremely simple to
install and implement. MongoDB uses JSON or BSON documents to
store data.




Project Scope
◦ The options are never-ending. Basically, the whole World is your
cookbook. There are hundreds and thousands of recipes online, which
gives you an advantage of trying out new recipes and improvising without
buying expensive cookbooks.
◦ A visual medium for cooking always works wonders for people like me,
who aren't exactly gifted in the cooking department. Online videos show
you step-by-step instructions on how something is made that definitely
holds your interest better.
